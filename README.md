# my_pacman
pacman using c++ &amp; ncurses.
<br>This game was created as a university assignment around the summer of 2021 and has since been gradually improved. I still occasionally add code to it, and now it has become a more enjoyable game that can be played in the terminal.
<br>Instead of release notes, here are the features that have been added so far:

* Menu screen.
* Pause and resume functionality.
* Optimization of enemy characters.
* Invincibility item.

## What is Nucurses?
Ncurses (or Ncursesw) is a library for managing screens, keystrokes, cursors, etc. in CUI.

## Usage

Install ncurses.
* Linux (include WSL)
  ```sh
  sudo apt install ncurses-dev
  ```
* Mac
  ```sh
  brew install ncurses
  ```

Build.
```sh
make
```
Run.
```sh
./pacman
```
> **Note**
> <br>I tested this program on my WSL2-Windows11 PC and M1-MacbookAir. Any probrems!
